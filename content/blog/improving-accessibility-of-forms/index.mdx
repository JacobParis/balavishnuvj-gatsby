  "Building an accessible login form to reduce drop offs and better UX"

import { BadForm, OkForm, BetterForm } from "./components.jsx"

Forms are an essential part of the web. Most of us would have built at least one
form per app. For me, it has been one of the most difficult part in developing
any app in web. Most of the applications we build would also have some kind of
sign up/ login forms. Often they are not accessible and/or leaves a lot to be
desired in terms of UX.

Let us try to understand this by creating a login form.

### Bad

This is a not so good version of a login form. It is not accessible nor user
friendly. Form won't submit if you hit return key, it won't suggest email in the
email field. And in a real world app, it won't even prompt to save password.

_Go ahead and try it yourself!_ **It is interactable!!! ðŸ¥³**

<BadForm />

```jsx
function Form() {
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({})
  function handleChange(name, value) {
    setState(current => ({ ...current, [name]: value }))
  }
  function handleSubmit() {
    alert(JSON.stringify(state))
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Login</h3>
      <div>
        <span>Email</span>
        <input
          onChange={event => handleChange("username", event.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <div>
        <span>Password</span>
        <input
          type="password"
          placeholder="password"
          onChange={event => handleChange("password", event.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      <div onClick={handleSubmit}>Login</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

And here how it would look in action. This is not an exaggerated code. The above
code sample is what I have seen in a real-world application. This is how NOT to
build a form.

This form is broken (not accessible at all), let us make this form work. We need
some basic functionality like suggest emails, accessible by keyboard and screen
readers, ability to submit form by hiting return key etc.

### Good

To improve accessibility and UX. We can achieve this by using semantic elements,
instead of using `<div>`'s for everything.

Let's use `<form>` to wrap our forms, `<label>` for labels of input (placeholders
are not enough), and `<button>` for buttons. This might seem very obvious, but
there are plenty of websites which don't follow this.

<OkForm />

```diff
function Form() {
-  const [state, setState] = React.useState({})
-  function handleChange(name, value) {
-    setState(current => ({ ...current, [name]: value }))
-  }
  function handleSubmit(event) {
-    alert(JSON.stringify(state))
+    event.preventDefault()
+    const { elements } = event.target
+    const { email, password } = elements
+    alert(JSON.stringify({ email: email.value, password: password.value }))
  }

  return (
-    <div>
+    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h3>Login</h3>
      <section>
-        <span>Email</span>
+        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
       <input
-          placeholder="E-Mail"
-          onChange={event => handleChange("username", event.target.value)}
+          id="email"
+          name="email"
+          type="email"
+          required
        />
      </section>
      <section>
-        <span>Password</span>
+        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input
          type="password"
-          placeholder="password"
-          onChange={event => handleChange("password", event.target.value)}
+          id="password"
+          name="password"
+          required
       />
      </section>
-      <div onClick={handleSubmit}>Login</div>
+      <button id="login" type="submit">
+       Login
+      </button>
-    </div>
+    <form>
  )
}
```

Both these forms look very similar. But they are miles apart when it comes to
accessibility. Now input has proper labels, screen readers can now read labels
correctly. And we get tons of bonus features too ðŸ•º.

- When we click/tap on the label, the corresponding input is focussed.

- We don't have to maintain state value if we don't need to. We can get all
  field values from `event.target.elements[NAME_OF_THE_FIELD]`

- We can submit the form by hitting the enter/return key.

Also we can get browsers to prompt save password. To get that working, we should
let the browser know that the form submit was successful. We can do that by
either navigating to a new page. Or by calling `history.pushState` or
`history.replaceState` and `<form>` needs to be removed from the page.

Hold on, that's not it. We can make it better. ðŸ¤¯

### Better

We can improve this by letting the browser know what kind of value we are
expecting from these fields. For that we can use `autocomplete` attribute.

<BetterForm />

```diff
function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault()
    const { elements } = event.target
-    const { email, password } = elements
+    const { email, "current-password": password } = elements
    alert(JSON.stringify({ email: email.value, password: password.value }))
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <h3>Login</h3>
      <section>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
        <input
          id="email"
          name="email"
          type="email"
+         autoComplete="username"
          required
        />
      </section>
      <section>
        <label htmlFor="password">Password</label>
        <input
-          id="password"
-          name="password"
+          id="current-password"
+          name="current-password"
+          autoComplete="current-password"
          type="password"
          required
        />
      </section>
      <button id="login" type="submit">
        Login
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Autocomplete makes the UX a lot better. Few other values which might be helpful
for sign-up. for eg.

```jsx
// for new passwords
  <input
    // ...other fields
    autoComplete="new-password"
  />

  // for OTPs
  <input
    // ...other fields
    autoComplete="one-time-code"
  />
```

`new-password` is interesting and required because it wouldn't prefill existing
password in password reset scenario or if someone else is trying to sign-up from
the same machine. And the cool thing about `new-password` is modern browsers
will suggest secure passwords.

`autocomplete` is a nice feature which we forget to use most of the time. This
helps in assisting the user in filling out the form reliably (avoid typos) and
faster. There are around ~50 possible values for auto-complete. Check them out
at
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete).

There are a lot of things we can improve. Listing down a few

- use `aria-describedby` to describe any specific constraint on the field. eg.
  Password has to 8 chars.
- use `autofocus` in the input, if that is the first input of the form that user
  would be filling etc. eg. username in our login form.
- other UX improvements like size, the contrast of the text. Would recommend
  checking [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/). Only add login if your
  application really needs it.

## TL;DR

Use semantic HTML; `form` for forms, `button` for buttons etc. Make it
accessible by having proper labels (aria properties too). UX can be improved by
using the `autocomplete` attribute of the input.

This might seem very small, but we often miss this. Let us check the apps we
have developed are accessible or not. We should try to make our apps more
accessible. By far this is not enough but this is a good start.

I have focussed on Login/Sign-Up forms, but this can be translated to any forms
you make. Drop-offs in Sign Up could be drastically improved with these minor
changes. Let me know if this helped your application.
