React Native gives you incredible power to share code between multiple
platforms. Even though the library natives supports only Android and iOS
application. It is not that difficult to support the web.

## How to share code

React Native makes it convenient to share code across platforms.

So by default in React Native can share the code between Android and iOS. But we
might not want to share complete 100% of the code in all these platforms (for
any reason).

And to share the code with Web, we can bring in any web project, let's say CRA
into a React Native CLI app. We should be good to go. We will talk more about a
bit later.

## Platform specific code

Okay, if you are planning to merge web, android, and iOS into one single code
base. Let's see if we have considered everything.

### Android, iOS and Others(Web)

There are a couple of ways to have platform-specific code.

If it is minor inline change, we can do something like this.

```js
import { Platform, StyleSheet } from "react-native"

if (Platform.OS === "ios") {
  // do something
} else {
  // do something else
}

// we can also do
const data = Platform.select({
  ios: {
    ownedBy: "Apple",
  },
  android: {
    ownedBy: "Google",
  },
  default: {
    ownedBy: "Me",
  },
})
// when running for iOS data = { ownedBy: "Apple" }
// and for android  data = { ownedBy: "Google" }
// and for all other cases = { ownedBy: "Me" }

// If want code same for android and ios, and different for Web.

const data = Platform.select({
  native: {
    ownedBy: "Corporate",
  },
  default: {
    ownedBy: "Me",
  },
})
```

I wouldn't use it more often, might get hard to track. Just from a
maintainability point of view. Try to use as minimum as possible.

I would prefer if a complete module(or a function) is switched instead, we can
achieve that by

```js
/*
└── Button
    ├── index.js
    ├── index.native.js
    ├── index.android.js
    └── index.ios.js
*/

import Button from "./Button"
// <Button />
```

So for Web, let's say we are using Webpack as the bundler, and for React Native
metro(default by React native).

So when the metro bundler is looking for a module (module resolution). Let's
assume that we are running an iOS device it is building for iOS it would start
looking for **\*.ios.js** (\*.android.js) then **index.native.js** and finally
**index.js**.

And webpack willresolve the module as we generally do **index.js**. It wouldn't
even care (or know) about other files (eg. \*.android.js) as we are never
importing them.

## How much should we share?

So much of code can we share? And more importantly, how much should we share?

There a very interesting projects like
[react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web), with such
libraries we can share almost 100% of the code. But should we really resuse all
100%?

Let's see what kind of code we would have in a typical application

- Platform (eg. Microphone, Location. these are platform-specific)
- UI/UX (eg. Buttons, Cards, DatePickers)
- Business logic

**Platform** code can't be re-used. We can write wrapper(or find libraries, few
of them are inbuilt in React Native), but we can't reuse what is written for
andriod in iOS. Look into
[Native Modules](https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-setup) for more
details on how to write React Native Modules.

**UI/UX** This is very interesting to me, on the surface, it looks like we can
share almost 100% of the UI in all platforms. I advise against it.

The primary reason is, user's of a specific platform is used to specific kind of
UI/UX patterns. A Web user expectation of clicking a link in an app might be
different from an iOS user. How navigation works might be different. Look at
[this](https://github.com/react-native-datetimepicker/datetimepicker) example of
how UI/UX for a date picker is different for iOS and Android. Or how the
[button](https://reactnative.dev/docs/button) looks and behaves differently.

Because of the different expectation of the user in each platform, and if you
try to build a UI/UX that works for everyone. You might be making an application
that isn't great for anyone.

But how much you can share would depend completely based on how your
application's design language. Let you UI designers design based on the
platform, not the tech stack.

**Business logic** is the best part of React and Hooks made it better. We should
be able to share almost 100% of our Business logic. Custom hooks makes it so
much easier for sharing logic.

You should be aware of not all web platform APIs are poly-filled for React
Native. for eg. `window.setTimeout` is but `window.localStorage` isn't. When you
making reusable hooks, make sure you are considering them.

## So that's it?

All we can share is some logic? Not really you can share UI too, but I would
recommend not to lean into that it too much. Even considering the difference in
UI/UX you might still be able to share about 60-70% of the UI code/components.

_Note: Almost all the component provided in React Native, follow this pattern of
following the UI/UX of how the platform prefers and have the same API to handle
them. There are few cases where a particular pattern is supported in only one of
the platform._

What React Native does very well, is your ability to make that logic and UI
interact.

```jsx
import { useCounter } from "./hooks"
import Button from "./Button" // having different implemention like above

function Counter() {
  const [count, increment] = useCounter(0)
  /*onClick will have to aliased to onPress in native implemention*/
  return <Button onClick={increment}>{count}</Button>
}
```

Isn't that awesome? We have the UI/UX that each user of each platform prefer and
we can share as much code as possible.

Let's build an application that is as great as possible for every platform.
