React hooks have made sharing application logic easier. We achieve a lot of that
by creating custom hooks. In this blog, we will talk about using callbacks in a
custom hook. It is powerful, and it comes with some caveats. I wouldn't call it
caveats, it comes with a different model of programming with React. We should be
aware of those "caveats" when we write custom hooks.

Let us learn by example. We will build a custom hook for `setInterval`. We will
call `useInterval`. The custom hook would do pretty much similar to what
`setInterval` would do but in a declarative way. It would take a callback and
interval as arguments and call the callback at the given interval.

The function signature will look like:

```js
function useInterval(callback, interval) {
  // implementation of useInterval
}
```

So we want to call the callback, after the interval. And clear the interval to
avoid memory leak and other potential bugs. So a very naive implementation of
`useInterval` would look like this:

```js
function useInterval(callback, interval) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(callback, interval)
    return () => clearInterval(id)
  }, [interval])
}

function Counter() {
  let [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(count + 1)
  }, 1000)
  return <h1>{count}</h1>
}
```

You might have already seen the problem with the implementation. Let us use this
version of the hook and see for it ourself.

<CounterWithMissingDep />

---

`callback` is missing from the dependency array, because of that the `count` is
enclosed on `0`. And because of that, we get the counter to update from `0` to
`1` after every interval.

```js {5}
function useInterval(callback, interval) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(callback, interval)
    return () => clearInterval(id)
  }, [interval])
}
```

We can fix that by adding `callback` to the dependency array.

```js {5}
function useInterval(callback, interval) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(callback, interval)
    return () => clearInterval(id)
  }, [interval, callback])
}
```

<CounterWithDeps />

So now that app looks like it working, so thats it?

No not really! Lets add another counter, and see how the app works.

```js
function Counter() {
  let [count1, setCount1] = useState(0)
  let [count2, setCount2] = useState(0)

  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(count1 + 1)
  }, 1000)

  useInterval(() => {
    setCount2(count2 + 1)
  }, 2000)

  return (
    <h1>
      {count1}, {count2}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

<DoubleCounter />

---

You would have noticed that our second counter is never incremented. Why would
that be the case?

Lets refactor a bit, and see what is happening.

```js
function Counter() {
  let [count1, setCount1] = useState(0)
  let [count2, setCount2] = useState(0)

  function handleFirstCounter() {
    setCount1(count1 + 1)
  }

  function handleSecondCounter() {
    setCount2(count2 + 1)
  }

  useInterval(handleFirstCounter, 1000)
  useInterval(handleSecondCounter, 2000)

  return (
    <h1>
      {count1}, {count2}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

It is because of when `count` of our first counter changes, the `Counter`
component is re rendered. Because of this `callback` is recreated.

So lets list down the what has happens:

1. `count` and `count2` are 0, interval for `1s` and `2s` is set.
2. After the first second `count1` is updated to `2` and `Counter` is
   re-rendered.
3. Causes `handleFirstCounter` and `handleSecondCounter` to be redefined.
4. Since `useInterval` has `callback` as dependency, it clears the old
   intervals. For both `count1` and `count2`, a new interval is created.
5. Interval for `count2` is never called because interval for `count1` gets
   called before `count2` and handlers are reset.

So we need `callback` to hold the latest state. But we can't list it in
dependency.

Isn't that `useCallback` is meant for? Let's try wrapping `handleFirstCounter`
and `handleSecondCounter` in `useCallback` with dependencies as `[]`.

```js
function Counter() {
  let [count1, setCount1] = useState(0)
  let [count2, setCount2] = useState(0)

  const handleFirstCounter = useCallback(() => {
    setCount1(c => c + 1)
  }, [])

  const handleSecondCounter = useCallback(() => {
    setCount2(c => c + 1)
  }, [])

  useInterval(handleFirstCounter, 1000)
  useInterval(handleSecondCounter, 2000)

  return (
    <h1>
      {count1} {count2}
    </h1>
  )
}
```

<DoubleCounterWithMemo />

---

So our app is working, but did we solve the problem? We didn't. We just
prolongated it. `handleFirstCounter`'s reference will change if it is using some
other state.

for eg.

```js
const handleFirstCounter = useCallback(() => {
  setCount1(c => c + step)
}, [])
```

<DoubleCounterWithStep />

---

This would again mess up the "stability" of our function. And it would act
weirdly (a count is missed when the step is changed). Hit the step button
continuously you should be able see the counter paused.

So here is the solution to our problem. We are saving the callback function in
ref.

```js {4-7,10-12,14}
function useInterval(callback, interval) {
  const callbackRef = useRef()

  useEffect(() => {
    callbackRef.current = callback // Update ref to the latest callback.
  }, [callback])

  // Set up the interval.
  useEffect(() => {
    function cb() {
      callbackRef.current()
    }
    if (interval !== null) {
      let id = setInterval(cb, interval)
      return () => clearInterval(id)
    }
  }, [interval])
}
```

<FinalDoubleCounterWithStep />

---

We saw that the counter was kind of "paused" in our previous example. And in our
current example, if you do the same you will find that counter would still work.

Some of you might think, we might want to pause the counter while the `steps` is
being changed. We can achieve that with setting `interval` as `null`.

**So why does this solution work?**

This solution works because `cb` inside our `useEffect` will never change inside
the effect. And the effect will only run when the interval changes. And we can
point to the lastest function by updating the reference
`callbackRef.current = callback`

This solution also allows us to give the freedom to the user to use
`useCallback` or `inline` function, our application will work fine.

Ability to pass a function as a parameter is what makes Javascript so powerful.
We would accept a function as arguments in a custom hook. If your custom hook is
accepting a function as an argument and that is listed as a dependency to
`useEffect` or as a callback let us try using `useRef`. It enables us to have a
better API and stable hook.
