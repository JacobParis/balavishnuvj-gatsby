We all would have struggled at least once to get someone to review our Pull
Requests(here on will refer it as PRs). When get someone to review the PR. It
takes few decades to get it approved üòù.

There are questions on why this decision was taken. Something they didn't like
the way the code was looking. We could go on and on. Because of unknown time of
when the review would be approved. And now everyone is frustrated about this.
Author is not able complete the task and move on to next one, reviewers is still
reviewing the PR, PMs haven't got the feature released yet.

Let us try to improve this process. To be quick and effective.

## 1. Prepare

Let's try not to surprise the reviewer.Discuss the approach before jumping to
write. This would help in getting the implementation and overall understanding
of the feature. Also get this should documented in any form your team is
comfortable with. It could be any form of taking documents, but it should be
traceable later.

Documents could be like Technical Design Documents(TDDs), Technical Review
Documents(TRDs), Product Requirement Documents(PRDs), UI/UX design or just a
doc. You don't need everything, but as much info you can provide. Better it
would be for you and the peers to review. And even better when you want to track
later.

Once you have a mental model of how you would solve your problem(I plan the file
structure, function names, sometimes even variable names.). You can start
writing your code.

This step is very important after this step everyone should be on the same page.
There would be small changes later, but that would be minimal and over time
these changes would reduce.

Try to split the PR into logically smaller pieces such that the entire PR makes
sense at the same time it is not too big. Try to avoid huge PRs.

## 2. Code

While writing code, make sure you add enough comments and tests.

### 3. Review

I generally categorize any review comment into three categories viz. Cosmetics,
Opinions, Critical, and Appreciations.

We should avoid reviewing the PR along with the author. Also if
possible/required we should checkout the branch and look at the application
running.

#### Cosmetics

These are changes like use tabs and spaces, single quotes and double-quotes.
Anything that doesn't affect the quality of the code, but mostly for
consistency.

We would want to avoid such comments in the PR. Ideally, we should have some
formatter and linter which would catch such issues. So that there is no human
intervention required.

If you are not able to write these style guidelines for these conventions you
follow, at least document it somewhere. And the whole team can just follow the
guidelines. I would prefer to avoid such things. It would look something like
Airbnb's JS guideline).

#### Opinions

We would want to reduce these too. These are generally such comments where there
are x,y and z ways to solve the same problem. Our preparation step would help us
a lot in reducing such opinions during the review.

things like different abstractions, or handling "future" cases, etc. We would
want to avoid such comments at this stage as much as possible.

We could also suggest better variable names etc.

#### Critical

This is the real deal. You might want to comment out the typos, possible bugs,
pitfalls, etc. If you are not able to understand why something is done in a
certain way, feel free to ask for documentation to avoid offline communication
here(like the author explaining to you on call why that change was done). You
would want those missing in understanding to be documented.

#### Appreciations

Something we might miss during these reviews is appreciating the author if you
find something cool. Or some smart way to solve a problem. Or even junior‚Äôs PR,
where they have done a good job. These appreciations are really important too.
Even celebrate when a major task is done, like an upgrade. Or long overdue
migration.

This can be anywhere, in the PR comments or offline(calls, messages or telling
them directly). But make sure you do üòÄ.

## TL;DR;

- Discuss the approach before starting to code, document the same.
- Have machines to format and lint code, avoid those in PR.
- Comment important things, ask for an explanation, add comments.
- Appreciate the author
