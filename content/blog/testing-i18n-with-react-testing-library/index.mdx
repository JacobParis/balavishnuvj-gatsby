---

Usually when we are testing applications with React Testing, we write queries
like `screen.getByRole("list", { name: /fruits/i })`. But when our applications
have to support Internationalization(i18n) and/or localization(l10n), we won’t
be able to use same queries as above. Because our labels would most likely be
something like `t('list.heading')`. Of course, in this case, our identifier for
the label can be `t('Fruits')` but this doesn’t scale well for longer and
namespaced texts.

I would be using the `i18next` library for managing languages and `jest` as a
test runner. However, the pattern followed here can be applied to other
libraries too.

### What do we want

We want to support two kinds of queries.

```js
screen.getByRole("list", { name: /fruits/i })
screen.getByRole("list", { name: "list.heading" })
```

**screen.getByRole("list", { name: /fruits/i })**

Supporting these kinds of queries would make our writing and reading tests
easier. As it would be much closer to what the user would read. But this comes
with the cost of loading translations in every test, as this could be painful in
Unit/Integrations tests.

**screen.getByRole("list", { name: "list.heading" })**

These kinds of queries are easy to write, as we don't have to load the
translations in every test. But it gets difficult to read later. Then why do we
want to support such queries if they can become hard to read? These kinds of
queries help write tests where the text is not relevant.

Since we want actual translations to work, we **wouldn't be mocking** the
i18next.

### Let's write some code

Let's start with creating utils

```js
import i18n from "i18next"

const DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = "en"
const DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = "translations"

export function initI18n(translations = {}) {
  i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
    lng: DEFAULT_LANGUAGE,
    fallbackLng: DEFAULT_LANGUAGE,
    ns: [DEFAULT_NAMESPACE],
    defaultNS: DEFAULT_NAMESPACE,
    debug: false,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false,
    },
    resources: { [DEFAULT_LANGUAGE]: { [DEFAULT_NAMESPACE]: translations } },
  })
}
```

So we have created a utility that would initialize i18next with a default
language and translation.

Let's initiate this before we run any test. We can add this in
`setupFilesAfterEnv`

```js
import { initI18n } from "./test-utils"

beforeAll(() => {
  initI18n()
})
```

I prefer initialising with no translations. This would ensure where ever
translations are required we can load them on demand.

Anyways, we should be able to add some test now.

```js
it("should render list of fruits", () => {
  render(<FruitList />)
  const list = screen.getByRole("list", {
    name: /list.heading/i,
  })
})
```

This looks okay, but we should be able to add actual text in the tests too. So
let's create a utility to do that too.

```js
export function addI18nResources(
  resource = {},
  { ns = DEFAULT_NAMESPACE, lang = DEFAULT_LANGUAGE } = {}
) {
  i18n.addResourceBundle(lang, ns, resource, true, true)
}
```

Now we should be able to load translations.

```js
import { addI18nResources } from "test-utils"

it("should render list of fruits", () => {
  addI18nResources({ landing: { heading: "Fruits" } })
  render(<FruitList />)
  const list = screen.getByRole("list", {
    name: /fruits/i,
  })
})
```

This one looks great, but there is a minor bug. Are you able to spot it?

Let me help you.

**Snippet 1**

```js
import { addI18nResources } from "test-utils"

it("should render list of fruits without translation", () => {
  render(<FruitList />)
  const list = screen.getByRole("list", {
    name: /list.heading/i,
  })
})

it("should render list of fruits with translation", () => {
  addI18nResources({ landing: { heading: "Fruits" } })
  render(<FruitList />)
  const list = screen.getByRole("list", {
    name: /fruits/i,
  })
})
```

**Snippet 2**

```js
import { addI18nResources } from "test-utils"

it("should render list of fruits with translation", () => {
  addI18nResources({ landing: { heading: "Fruits" } })
  render(<FruitList />)
  const list = screen.getByRole("list", {
    name: /fruits/i,
  })
})

it("should render list of fruits without translation", () => {
  render(<FruitList />)
  const list = screen.getByRole("list", {
    name: /list.heading/i,
  })
})
```

Our `Snippet 1` would pass but `Snippet 2` would fail.

**Stop here if you want to think about why `Snippet 1` and `Snippet 2` would act
differently.**

Okay, so the problem is when we add mock using `addI18nResources` the
resources(mocks) are loaded, but they are never cleaned. We can call
`addI18nResources` in one of our `setupFilesAfterEnv`.

### Wrapping up

Now it should something like

```js
import { initI18n } from "./test-utils"

const INITIAL_TRANSLATION = {}

beforeAll(() => {
  initI18n(INITIAL_TRANSLATION)
})

afterEach(() => {
  // this would remove all existing translation and load initial one.
  addI18nResources(INITIAL_TRANSLATION)
})
```

And our `test-utils.js` whould look like

```js
import i18n from "i18next"

const DEFAULT_LANGUAGE = "en"
const DEFAULT_NAMESPACE = "translations"

export function initI18n(translations = {}) {
  i18n.use(initReactI18next).init({
    lng: DEFAULT_LANGUAGE,
    fallbackLng: DEFAULT_LANGUAGE,
    ns: [DEFAULT_NAMESPACE],
    defaultNS: DEFAULT_NAMESPACE,
    debug: false,
    interpolation: {
      escapeValue: false,
    },
    resources: { [DEFAULT_LANGUAGE]: { [DEFAULT_NAMESPACE]: translations } },
  })
}

export function addI18nResources(
  resource = {},
  { ns = DEFAULT_NAMESPACE, lang = DEFAULT_LANGUAGE } = {}
) {
  i18n.addResourceBundle(lang, ns, resource, true, true)
}
```

**Note:** We are mocking the translation resources without actually calling the
network request. I felt this was a simple approach without setting up the actual
network mocks in every test. Reach out to me if you want me to cover that in
this blog too.

Now we should be able to support both kinds of queries in our tests. I hope this
was helpful.
