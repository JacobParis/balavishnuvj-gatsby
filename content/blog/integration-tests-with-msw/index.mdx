  "Let your tests mock network requests not stub libraries. Mock Service
  Worker(MSW) would help us."

I prefer writing more integration tests than unit tests. I talk about that in
[Testing: Building application with confidence](https://balavishnuvj.com/blog/testing-building-application-with-confidence/).
While writing integration tests, you might have a nested child component that is
making some network API calls. And that becomes bit difficult to mock when you
don't know/care which component is making API calls.

There isn't an easy way to know if there are any APIs that are mocked or not.

```js
import axios from "axios"

export const USER_API_ENDPOINT = "/api/v1/user"
export const DETAIL_API_ENDPOINT = "/api/v1/detail"

export function fetchUser() {
  return axios.get(API_ENDPOINT)
}

export function fetchDetail() {
  return axios.get(DETAIL_API_ENDPOINT)
}
```

Let's say we have these API calls somewhere in our application. Even after we
identify that we have two API calls made from some nested child component.
Mocking them isn't that easy either.

We either have to find an `axios` mocking library or do some magic üîÆ to get all
these mocks to work. We might have to do something like this

```js {9-11}
jest.mock("axios")

axios.get.mockImplementation(url => {
  switch (url) {
    case "/api/v1/user":
      return Promise.resolve({ result: { user: "foo" } })
    case "/api/v1/detail":
      return Promise.resolve({ result: { detail: "bar" } })
    default:
      return Promise.reject(new Error(`${url} doesn't have a mock defined`))
  }
})

test("should successfully fetch user", () => {
  // test assertions
})

test("should successfully fetch details", () => {
  // test assertions
})

test("should fail fetch user", () => {
  // test assertions
})
```

This works fine, but now how would you change the mocks for a particular test
case. At this point, we could use libraries like
[nock](https://github.com/nock/nock). But it needs additional adapters if we are
using libraries like `axios`.

Even after going through all of this, when we have to update libraries, switch
from `axios` to `fetch` or to any new shiny library, We would have to
update/rewrite all these tests.

And another major problem I have faced is when we use any third-party SDKs. And
they make API calls. We can't mock them reliably. Also, it is difficult to
detect the API calls it is making.

So the problems I was facing are:

1. Detecting all the API calls made.
2. Handling different mock results for a particular test case.
3. Changing mock for a particular test case.
4. Handling third-party APIs (or SDKs)
5. Tests were fragile for refactoring to a new or upgrading library

### MSW to the rescue

Need not be said, I wasn't happy with the tests we were writing. During this
time I came across the [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) library. It was
officially recommended by [React Testing library](https://testing-library.com/)
for mocking APIs.

So I fiddled around `MSW` for some time to see if it solves my problem. And it
did solve the problems I listed above.

I realised within a few minutes of trying out `MSW`, that I was mocking networks
calls. And earlier I was just stubbing/monkey patching implementation of network
request making libraries.

This is amazing üï∫, I don't know why we didn't have MSW. And why wasn't it a
thing until recently?

**1. Detecting all the API calls made.**

I have this running in `setupFilesAfterEnv` of jest

```js {9-11}
// test-utils
import { setupServer } from "msw/node"

export const server = setupServer()

// setup-after-env
import { server } from "test-utils"
beforeAll(() => {
  server.listen({
    onUnhandledRequest: "warn",
  })
})

afterEach(() => {
  server.resetHandlers()
})

afterAll(() => {
  server.close()
})
```

So `onUnhandledRequest` in `server.listen` helps me in detecting API calls those
are not mocked.

**2. Handling different mock results each one of them.**

We can attach handlers to `MSW` "server" to respond to the API endpoints. Let's
update those tests we wrote in the beginning, and see how it looks now.

```js
import { server } from "test-utils"

beforeEach(() => {
  server.use(
    rest.get("/api/v1/user", (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json({ result: { user: "foo" } }))
    }),
    rest.get("/api/v1/detail", (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json({ result: { detail: "bar" } }))
    })
  )
})

test("should successfully fetch user", () => {
  // test assertions
})

test("should successfully fetch details", () => {
  // test assertions
})
```

**3. Changing mock for a particular test case.**

We can use `server.use` to update the API response in each test cases. If we
want this to apply only once, we can also do `res.once`.

```js {23-29}
import { server } from "test-utils"

beforeEach(() => {
  server.use(
    rest.get("/api/v1/user", (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json({ result: { user: "foo" } }))
    }),
    rest.get("/api/v1/detail", (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res(ctx.json({ result: { detail: "bar" } }))
    })
  )
})

test("should successfully fetch user", () => {
  // test assertions
})

test("should successfully fetch details", () => {
  // test assertions
})

test("should fail fetch user", () => {
  server.use(
    rest.get("/api/v1/user", (req, res, ctx) => {
      return res.once(
        ctx.status(500),
        ctx.json({ message: "Internal server error" })
      )
    })
  )
  // test assertions
})
```

**4. Handling thirdparty APIs (or SDKs)**

When it comes to handling API calls for third-party APIs, it is exactly same as
we would do for our APIs.

```js
server.use(
  rest.get("https://www.somethirdpartyapi.com/api/foo", (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ result: "Third party response" }))
  })
)
```

But sometimes, we would be using third-party SDKs. In such cases, the endpoint
used to make API call is an implementation detail of the SDK. We shouldn't be
testing based on that. So we could do something like

```js
import { server } from "test-utils"
import { sdk } from "./handlers/sdk"

server.use(
  sdk("ListResources", (req, res, ctx) => {
    return res(ctx.json({ id: 1 }))
  })
)
```

Look at
[Custom request handler](https://mswjs.io/docs/recipes/custom-request-handler)
more details.

**5. Tests were fragile for refactoring to a new or upgrading library**

So let's remove `axios` and use `fetch` instead. And let's see what we need to
update in our tests.

```diff
-import axios from "axios"
+async function fetchGet(url) {
+  const response = await fetch(url);
+  const json = await response.json();
+  return json;
+}

export const USER_API_ENDPOINT = "/api/v1/user"
export const DETAIL_API_ENDPOINT = "/api/v1/detail"

export function fetchUser() {
-  return axios.get(API_ENDPOINT)
+  return fetchGet(API_ENDPOINT)
}

export function fetchDetail() {
-  return axios.get(DETAIL_API_ENDPOINT)
+  return fetchGet(DETAIL_API_ENDPOINT)
}

```

You know what, we don't have to change a single character in our tests. This is
awesome ü•≥!!!.

### Conclusion

Mock Service Worker solves most of the problems I have with mocking APIs while
testing. It need not be just REST APIs, it can do `graphql` requests too.

All those handlers we wrote for testing can be used during development too.

Something I miss from mocking `fetch` or using `nock`, is the ability to assert
on the request params (such as search params or body). When we mock something,
we are creating holes in the application. To patch those holes, we would need
some kind of assertions to make sure our mocks are not tearing apart the
reality. For eg. When we mock functions, we do check if they were called X
times, what params was it called with. There are ways to handle it in `msw`, but
I'm not very happy about the solutions.

We didn't have to know about what libraries were used to make API calls, we
didn't have to change anything in our code to make API mocks work. This is
possible because we are not mocking libraries, we are mocking network requests!
Thank you [Artem Zakharchenko](https://twitter.com/kettanaito) for creating MSW
üëè. It is awesome!
