When done right, abstractions are powerful. Though they are difficult, tricky
and need maintenance they help to reuse the same code in different places.
Fixing a bug in one place would mean fixing in all other places where they are
used. But when they go wrong (as they often do), they don't age well. They
resist change and become very difficult to manage.

How does this happen? It happens due to principles like DRY and Write Everything
Twice which inherently focus on duplication or redundancy in code. I am not
saying that these principles are bad by design, but that following them
religiously could lead to bad abstractions. Abstractions are difficult and a
good abstraction will change over time.

> "Duplication is far cheaper than the wrong abstraction"

_said [Sandi Metz](https://twitter.com/sandimetz) in
[The Wrong Abstraction](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)
and personally, I agree with her._

Initially an abstraction is added to handle a particular use case. Over time
when more and more similar use cases are added, it would look like a good
abstraction in the beginning, and later end up being very different from what
you had intended, as it had to handle too many use cases. An example for this is
Chinese whispers.

### A Clear Concept: An Example

Let me try to explain this with an example. Consider having a streaming
application with Free and Premium content. Paid customers get Premium + Free
content and free users get only Free content.

You start by checking if the user is premium or not and return the content on
this basis.

```js
// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const isPremium = user.premiumEndDate >= today
  return isPremium ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent) : freeContent
}
```

This seems fine, nothing fancy.

Later, you decided to add advertisements to your product. If the user is not a
premium member they are shown some ads.

```js
// home-banner.js
function getSellingScreen(user) {
  const isPremium = user.premiumEndDate >= today
  return isPremium ? null : sellingScreen
}
```

As soon as you give this for review, your colleague says “Hey, I have seen
isPremium check before. Can you abstract that out?"

So you create a new abstraction in your shared folder with user-membership.js
and introduce a method to check membership.

```js {2-4,8,14}
// user-membership.js
function isPremiumUser(user) {
  return user.premiumEndDate >= today
}

// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const isPremium = isPremiumUser(user)
  return isPremium ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent) : freeContent
}

// home-banner.js
function getSellingAds() {
  const isPremium = isPremiumUser(user)
  return isPremium ? null : sellingScreen
}
```

Later, the feature for a user to pause their premium membership is also
introduced.

This means, these users shouldn’t see **Premium Content** They also shouldn’t
see the selling ads.

```js
// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const isPremium = user.premiumEndDate >= today
  return isPremium ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent) : freeContent
}
```

Since your i`sPremiumUser` doesn't consider the state of the membership, you
introduce a check `onlyActive`. So you wouldn't break other places where this
abstraction is used and hence would default to `false`. So you decide to add
this condition in the abstraction itself. Thus you introduce a new field:
`membershipStatus` in your `User` entity.

You update both `getContent` and `getSellingAds`. You also rename the variable
to `isActivePremium` to have better understanding.

```js {2-8,12}
// user-membership.js
function isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive = false } = {}) {
  const isPremium = user.premiumEndDate >= today
  if (!onlyActive) {
    return isPremium
  }
  return isPremium && user.membershipStatus === "active"
}

// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const isActivePremium = isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive: true })
  return isActivePremium ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent) : freeContent
}

//  home-banner.js
function getSellingAds() {
  const isPremium = isPremiumUser(user)
  return isPremium ? null : sellingScreen
}
```

This looks good. Not too shabby for a Friday night push.

After a few weeks, you realise that premium users often forget to resume their
membership. So you decide to show a reminder in the banner space, where we used
to show ads, when a premium user is watching it.

Thus you update your `getSellingAds` method to handle the new cases. Let's also
update the name of the method to `getBannerContent`

```js {19,23-25}
// user-membership.js
function isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive = false } = {}) {
  const isPremium = user.premiumEndDate >= today
  if (!onlyActive) {
    return isPremium
  }
  return isPremium && user.membershipStatus === "active"
}

// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const isActivePremium = isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive: true })
  return isActivePremium ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent) : freeContent
}

//  home-banner.js
function getBannerContent() {
  const isPremium = isPremiumUser(user)
  const isPremiumActive = isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive: true })
  if (!isPremium) {
    return sellingScreen
  }
  if (!isPremiumActive) {
    return ResumeReminder
  }
  return null
}
```

Great work! You have successfully reused your abstraction. Now you give it for
review. But the Reviewer isn’t very happy. The meanings of the checks seem to be
very vague. For example,what is the difference between `isPremium` and
`isPremiumActive`? You convince your reviewer with well thought out comments.
Since your `getSellingAds` is not only showing ads but also reminder, you
renamed the function to `getBannerContent`.

A few weeks later, your premium content is given for a free trial. This means,
Users who are not premium members have to see the premium content. At the same
time,they should also see the ads. You decide to handle this use case in your
`isPremiumUser` by introducing another check `includeFreeTrial`, which again
defaults to `false`.

Now the code looks like this:

```js {4,7,11-14,18}
// user-membership.js
function isPremiumUser(
  user,
  { onlyActive = false, includeFreeTrial = false } = {}
) {
  const isPremium = user.planType === "premium"
  if (!onlyActive || !includeFreeTrial) {
    return isPremium
  }
  const isActivePremium = isPremium && user.isMembershipStatus === "active"
  const isUserFreeTrial = user.planType === "freeTrail"
  if (onlyActive && includeFreeTrial) {
    return isUserFreeTrial || isActivePremium
  }
  if (onlyActive) {
    return isActivePremium
  }
  return user.isUserFreeTrial
}

// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const isActivePremium = isPremiumUser(user, {
    onlyActive: true,
    includeFreeTrial: true,
  })
  return isActivePremium ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent) : freeContent
}

// home-banner.js
function getBannerContent() {
  const isPremium = isPremiumUser(user)
  const isPremiumActive = isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive: true })
  if (!isPremium) {
    return sellingScreen
  }
  if (!isPremiumActive) {
    return ResumeReminder
  }
  return null
}
```

At this point, `isPremiumUser` is handling too many cases. In the beginning we
thought only premium users could watch premium content. But that is not the case
anymore. So now you have too many boolean checks in the "abstraction" and you
are handling some unused cases like, `onlyActive = false` and
`includeFreeTrial = false`.

Not happy about this? No choice but to push it ahead as it is an urgent
requirement.

This is the first step where you should understand that your abstraction is
doing far more than it was intended to do. This happened because our initial
assumption that only premium users can watch premium content was wrong. And this
happens often and the right thing to do at this point is to take back a step. Re
consider: what exactly is your abstraction doing now? Do you still need this
abstraction? Your abstractions need to change with your business requirements.

So now you try to inline your abstractions, copy and paste the abstraction where
it is used. You can only do this if you have integration tests. If you don’t
have enough integration tests add them before inlining the abstractions.Unit
tests won’t help you here as you had mocked these abstractions.

```diff
// content.js
function getContent(user) {
+  const isFreeTrial = user.planType === "freeTrail"
-  const isActivePremium = isPremiumUser(user, {
-    onlyActive: true,
-    includeFreeTrial: true,
-  })
+  const isActivePremium =
+    user.planType === "premium" && user.membershipStatus === "active"
-  return isActivePremium
+  return isFreeTrial || isActivePremium
    ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent)
    : freeContent
}

// home-banner.js
function getBannerContent() {
-  const isPremium = isPremiumUser(user)
-  const isPremiumActive = isPremiumUser(user, { onlyActive: true })
-  if (!isPremium) {
+  if (user.planType !== "premium") {
    return sellingScreen
  }
- if (!isPremiumActive) {
+  if (user.membershipStatus !== "active") {
    return resumeReminder
  }
  return null
}
```

Now the code looks much cleaner despite no abstraction being used. Hold on! But
you still need abstractions! You can’t copy the same code over and over without
abstracting. Now it is clear that we have introduced planType and
membershipStatus which weren't there when we started, at which point we couldn't
have predicted this.

```js
// user-membership.js
function getUserPlanType(user) {
  return user.planType;
}

// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  const userPlanType = getUserPlanType(user);
  const isFreeTrial = userPlanType === 'freeTrail';
  const isPremium = userPlanType === ‘premium’;
  const isActivePremium = isPremium && user.membershipStatus === 'active';
  return isFreeTrial || isActivePremium
    ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent)
    : freeContent;
}

// home-banner.js
function getBannerContent() {
  const userPlanType = getUserPlanType(user);
  if (userPlanType !== 'premium') {
    return sellingScreen;
  }
  if (user.membershipStatus !== 'active') {
    return resumeReminder;
  }
  return null;
}
```

This is your new abstraction and here you have a simpler way of getting the plan
type: `getUserPlanType`. You could add another abstraction to membership status,
but you have already seen that it is not used much and decide to add it later.
This is perfectly okay: to have a duplicate code until you figure out a better
abstraction. A few weeks later, you might come across a new use case which could
give you a better idea on what to abstract and what not to.

Some might say that the abstraction is being used in too many places and that we
can’t just inline every usage. Again, this is okay and you can deprecate the use
of the old abstraction. You can then migrate on a case to case basis whenever
you are working on the module. After enough tries, you have come up with better
abstractions. You realised the abstraction you were looking for was
`isEligibleForPremiumContent` and not `isPremiumUser`.

```js
// user-membership.js
function isPremium(user) {
    return getUserPlanType(user) === ‘premium’;
}

function isFreeTrial(user) {
    return getUserPlanType(user) === ‘freeTrial’;
}

function isActivePremium(user) {
    return isPremium(user) && user.membershipStatus === 'active'
}

function isEligibleForPremiumContent(user) {
    return isFreeTrial(user) || isActivePremium(user);
}

function isPausedPremium(user) {
    return isPremium(user) && user.membershipStatus === ‘paused’;
}

// content.js
function getContent(user) {
  return isEligibleforPremiumContent(user)
    ? freeContent.concat(premiumContent)
    : freeContent;
}


// home-banner.js
function getSellingAds() {
  if (!isPremium(user)) {
    return sellingScreen;
  }
  if (isPausedPremium(user)) {
    return resumeReminder;
  }
  return null;
}
```

These are the few possible abstractions you could come up with after a few more
iterations. And when compared with the old abstraction, this looks much better.

#### Always remember:

- Similar looking code shouldn’t be the only criterion for abstraction, include
  your business requirement too.
- You will eventually end up in bad abstraction if you don’t pause to re-think
  the abstraction with changes in business requirements.
- It is okay to have duplicate code in a few places.
- Your integration tests need to be closer to your business logic rather than
  your abstractions.
- Keep your abstractions lean.

There is no hard and fast rule for good abstraction. It is okay to duplicate the
code until a good abstraction is found and does not mean that the same code will
be duplicated all over the codebase. Nobody wants to fix the same bug at 10
different places.

**Duplicate until you find your abstraction.**
